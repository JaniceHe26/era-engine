# era-engine
A simple Three.js wrapper to aid the creation of games or other visuals. Used by
 Slapshot and Earth.js

To build, run `npm run build`. The ERA engine uses Rollup, and builds to `build/era.js`.

To bring up a demo, run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:5000`. It will
be a blank screen, but you can interact with the engine in the console.
